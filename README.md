So, I'm refactoring all of my code to be up to date with the requirements, and I came across this thread:
https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/259245/python-text-based-game-room-to-room-movement
which I cannot understand at all. I mean I get how to change the list and get it to work with my rooms, but the logic is failing me.
I would not know how to change this to modify it for other projects. 
But I think this is technically the best way to go about it.

What I have now works a lot better than before though, much easier to add and remove rooms.
